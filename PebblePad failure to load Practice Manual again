As per the ZAE101 and ZAE104 discussion boards, PebblePad has simply failed to work when required.

If one thinks of PebblePad being the engine in your car, then picture for yourself, only being able to start the engine so you can drive somewhere, say going to work for instance, and the engine will only start for you 1 in 3 times at best. 

That's been my experience, and the stress and anxiety of it have finally resulted in my refusing to use it in the future.

Here is a link to a typical user experience for me.

What is shown in the video, is me trying to open a copy of my UTAS Practice Manual for the course I'm presently studying. What you can see in the video, is me opening a range of assets (think of these as the doors, windows, glove box, centre console, ashtray, CD player, etc of the car), opening a web search, opening a file, and yet completely failing to open the Practice Manual (the engine!) for which I am expected to put in two years of university evidence (those assets) to document my work.
